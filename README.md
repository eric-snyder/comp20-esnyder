1. The purpose of this repo is to serve as the basic repo for all of our assignments in the course, and, if we didn't have something similar already, to serve as a introductory portfolio of sorts.

2. My favorite assignment in this class is a toss up. On one hand, I totally loved being able to have my resume that I built from the ground up myself, and on the other, attacking a website built by someone else was extremely satisfying. The pleasure of being able to break something and feel like I have real-life skills is amazing.

3. I think I've grown a lot, but not in the traditional academic sense. Mostly in the idea that I now feel more comfortable taking control of my learning, and asking for more from my classes. I feel like I've grown to be more confident and demanding even as external pressures would push me to not be. It's an exciting change, and one that I am truly proud of.

4. The most important thing in this course was, as I said previously, that I've learned is to be self sufficient and demand more. There are 2 rather interesting real-life examples of this. One, I'm currently researching how to make a really tricked-out resume to host on github. I'm going to have a whole host of outside technologies to try and make it as beautiful and complete a website as possible. The other, and perhaps more tangible and positive from a career standpoint, is that I've been officially asked to build the personal website of a startup CMO in the area! I have my first real job because of this class.

5. I have 2 areas that I'm more interested in. Front end design, which is just tons of fun to play with and really see what kind of code-artwork you can make, and security. Security is probably what I will explore more thoroughly on my own -- it seems to be one of the most important issues of our time, and I want the tools to tackle it.
